<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I’m Glen Tabalan, a passionate web developer based in San Francisco, CA. With over 7 years of experience in crafting 
    innovative and user-centric web solutions, I specialize in turning complex ideas into clean, functional, and visually stunning
     websites.</p>
   <p>My journey into web development began with a love for problem-solving and design. After earning my degree in Information Technology
    from a University, I dove headfirst into the world of coding. Since then, I’ve had the pleasure of working with a 
    diverse range of clients, from tech startups to established businesses, helping them build their online presence and achieve 
    their digital goals.</p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <ul>
       <li><b>Front-End Development:</b> Mastering the art of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive user experiences. </li>
      <li><b>Back-End Development:</b> Leveraging technologies like Node.js, Python, and Ruby on Rails to build robust and scalable server-side solutions.</li>
      <li><b>UI/UX Design:</b> Combining aesthetic principles with user research to design intuitive and engaging interfaces.</li>
      <li><b>SEO Optimization:</b> Implementing best practices to ensure that your site not only looks great but also ranks well on search engines.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>My Approach</h2>
     <p>I believe in a user-first approach to web development. My process starts with understanding your needs and goals, 
      followed by meticulous planning and execution. I focus on clear communication and collaboration throughout the project, 
      ensuring that the final product not only meets but exceeds your expectations.</p>

  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring local coffee shops or hiking in the beautiful Bay Area.</li>
      <li>I’m a self-proclaimed tech geek with a soft spot for retro gaming and sci-fi novels.</li>
      <li>I’ve been known to brew a mean cup of coffee, so if you’re ever in the neighborhood, let’s chat over a cup!</li>
